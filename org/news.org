* <2025-01-21> Version 2.7.0 (LLVM15-19)

** Added
- Package lock support, based on SBCL's. Currently ignores local
  bindings. Thanks @bumblingbats.
- Add support for 80-bit and 128-bit LONG-FLOAT. Extended precision
  LONG-FLOAT is available on amd64 and non-Apple arm64 platforms. It
  is automatically detected and enabled.
- LLVM19 support.  
- Interrupts have now been organized into a coherent interface.
  Clasp will signal conditions of type MP:INTERRUPT at opportune
  times, and these conditions can be handled like any others.
- Extensions to Clasp and CANDO can now be built against an installed
  Clasp implementation and dynamically loaded. For an example see
  [[https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp-hello-world][clasp-hello-world]].

** Changed
- Floating point exceptions FE_INVALID, FE_OVERFLOW and FE_DIVBYZERO
  now signal the corresponding lisp errors by default.

** Fixed
- Pathnames and filesystem operations support Unicode ([[https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/1595][#1595]]).
- Package names support Unicode ([[https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/1596][#1596]]).
- Clasp threads can now be more reliably interrupted while they are
  blocking (e.g. waiting to grab a mutex, or for input).

* <2024-06-03> Version 2.6.0 (LLVM15-18)

** Added
- LLVM18 support.

** Changed
- Exit with error code when unknown option is present on command line.
- EVAL now uses bytecode, improving evaluation speed.
- Bytecode is now simpler for functions with &rest parameters, as well
  as functions that close over arguments.

** Fixed
- Avoid inserting fill newlines after newline format directive in
  logical block format directive.
- Don't buffer overrun when encoding UCS-4 streams.
- The bytecode system can properly handle functions with more than
  255 keyword parameters.
- Bytecode FASLs can contain multidimensional arrays specialized to
  sub-byte integer types.
- Avoid a double free when translating =const char*= arguments in the
  C++ bridge.
- =macroexpand= does not ignore shadowing function bindings ([[https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/1556][#1556]]).
- BTB compiler can handle closure variables deleted by optimization.
- =(setf elt)= calls =(setf sequence:elt)= properly on extended
  sequences.
- BTB compiler handles non-constant load-time-values.
- When =set-macro-character= is given a non-function, it signals an
  error without breaking the readtable.

** Optimized
- Single dispatch generic functions don't perform redundant argument
  count checks.

* <2024-01-01> Version 2.5.0 (LLVM15-17)

** Added
- New module named "gray-streams" which makes it possible to
  initialize the Gray stream protocol without calls to internal
  functions.
- New build mode =:bytecode-faso= which builds the kernel as native
  code (FASO) while the bytecode compiler is active.
- Generic =gray:stream-file-length= which implements =cl:file-length=
  for Gray streams.
- Generic versions of =cl:pathname= and =cl:truename=, both of which
  are available after the Gray stream modules is required.
- Generic =(setf gray:stream-element-type)=,
  =gray:stream-external-format=, and 
  =(setf gray:stream-external-format)= for basic support of bivalent 
  streams.
- Generic =gray:stream-file-string-length= which implements
  =cl:file-string-length= for Gray streams.
- The bytecode compiler warns about unused variables.

** Changed
- =cl:format= and =pprint= now respect the value returned by
  =gray:stream-line-length=.
- =cl:close= now uses the =:abort= argument to decide what to do with
  the resulting file. If =:abort= is non-NIL and the file was created
  as a result of =:if-does-not-exist :create= then the file is
  deleted. If =:abort= is non-NIL, there was an existing file and
  =:if-exists= is either =:supersede= or =:rename-and-delete= then the
  original file is restored.

** Removed
- Obsolete =:object=, =:ll=, =:bc=, and =:fasl= build modes.

** Fixed
- =cl:read-line= so it correctly returns lines that end with EOF.
- =cl:read-byte= so it respects the =eof-error-p= and =eof-value=
  arguments for Gray streams.

* <2023-10-01> Version 2.4.0 (LLVM15-17)

** Added
- Bytecode stores source location info for debugging.
- Bytecode stores variable info, so that variables can be viewed in
  the debugger.
- The bytecode compiler tracks source positions for error reporting.
- Circle detection for load forms in bytecode FASL.
- Bytecode functions can be compiled directly into native code with
  =cl:compile= (experimental).
- Cross-reference (xref) capability: Search for callers of a given
  function with =ext:who-calls=, and etc. Only works for bytecode
  right now.
- Support for Linux AARCH64.
- LLVM17 support. LLVM15 and LLVM16 are still supported.

** Changed
- Improved printing of backquote and unquote.

** Fixed
- Avoid segmentation faults from incorrectly calling MP:PROCESS-JOIN
  in EXT:RUN-PROGRAM.

* <2023-06-04> Version 2.3.0 (LLVM15-16)

** Added
- Bytecode compiled images via build mode =:bytecode=.
- FASL magic number sniffing for CL:LOAD. This enables FASL files to
  be loaded even if the filename extension is incorrect.
- Preliminary Apple Silicon support. Must be compiled with bytecode
  either by specifying =--build-mode=bytecode= when invoking koga or
  by adding =:build-mode :bytecode= to the config.sexp file.
- LLVM16 support. LLVM15 is still supported.

** Changed
- Updated to Eclector v0.9.0

** Fixed
- Use Eclector state protocol to enable readtable changes during
  compiling.  Fixes [[https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/1398][#1398]].

* <2023-03-01> Version 2.2.0 (LLVM15)

** Added
- =ext:describe-compiler-policy= to get information about the current
  behavior of the compiler.
- =gray:stream-line-length= Gray stream extension method.
- Support for building Clasp using CCL and ECL versus the default
  implementation of SBCL.
- Export of =ext:num-logical-processors= to return CPU count.

** Changed
- Updated to LLVM 15 and CLANG 15.

** Fixes
- Ensure that =print-unreadable-object= can accept output stream
  designators.
- Set stream column to zero after printing the prompt in a REPL. Fixes
  [[https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/1348][#1348]].
- Return correct values for =listen= when applied to file
  streams. This is done by checking for available bytes using read
  when poll/select indicate the next read will not block. Otherwise
  use non-blocking read. Fixes [[https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/1404][#1404]].
- Prevent format parameters from appearing after colon or at sign
  modifiers.
- Avoid putting NIL into simple LOOP when compiling format directives.

** Optimizations
- Arithmetic comparisons between floats and fixnums no longer cons.

* <2023-01-01> Version 2.1.0 (LLVM14)

** Added
- Add =ext:list-all-logical-hosts= and =ext:logical-host-p= functions
  to query the current logical host status.
- Operators for profiling CLOS code: =clos:with-profiling=

** Changed
- Removed stage and image format command line options (=-t= and =-T=)
  and replaced with options to specify image or snapshot file
  (=--image= or =--snapshot=) and =--base= option for loading base
  image when extensions are present.
- =print-unreadable-object= now prints qualified symbols for the
  =:type t= option and uses =pprint-logical-block= when pretty
  printing.
  
** Fixes
- =ext:run-program= works with string streams.
- =print-object= is now invoked for all calls to `write`.
- =slot-unbound= is called for unbound condition slots ([[https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/1390][#1390]]).
- Multiple inheritance of class-allocated slots is resolved
  breadth-first ([[https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/1392][#1392]]).

* <2022-10-26> Version 2.0.0 (LLVM14)

** Added
- Lisp based koga metabuilder that outputs Ninja build files.
- basic Debian packaging files.
- =core:*extension-systems*=, =core:*initialize-hooks*= and
  =core:*terminate-hooks= dynamic variables have been added to support new
  extension loading method. =core:*extension-systems*= is a list of keywords
  that name extension systems to load after Clasp starts and before =--load=
  and =--eval= command line options are processed. The remaining two variables
  are lists of functions that are called to do initialization before a REPL is
  started and termination after the REPL exits.
- =--script <file>= command line option which equivalent to passing =--norc=,
  =--noinform= and =--non-interactive=. Any shebang in =<file>= will also be 
  skipped.
- Asynchronous external process control with =ext:run-program=.
- Function =ext:temporary-directory= that returns the directory used for
  temporary files.
- Function =ext:printing-char-p= that returns non-NIL for graphic characters
  that are not blank glyphs. This is an extension of the ANSI specification
  that defines "printing" characters as graphic characters aside from the space
  character.

** Changed
- =core:lisp-implementation-id= and =core:clasp-git-full-commit= only return
  non-=NIL= values if Clasp was built in a git working tree.
- =graphic-char-p=, =alpha-char-p=, =alphanumericp=, =upper-case-p=, 
  =lower-case-p=, =both-case-p=, =char-upcase= and =char-downcase= now no longer 
  depend on C++ locale functions and are now generated directly from the Unicode 
  character tables.
- Loading of extensions such as Cando no longer uses startup scripts via LOAD.
  Instead the systems associated with each extension are loaded via QL:QUICKLOAD
  or as a fallback ASDF:LOAD-SYSTEM.
- Behavior of =--rc= command line option has changed. Relative paths passed via
  this option are no longer assumed to be located in the user's home directory.
- The logical hosts used by Clasp to locate source code and other components of
  Clasp has been changed. Only the reserved logical host SYS is now used. The
  default mappings for a system installed to =/usr/= are
  1. =SYS:LIB;**;*.*.*= ↦ =/usr/lib/clasp/**/*.*=
  2. =SYS:GENERATED;**;*.*.*= ↦ =/usr/share/clasp/generated/**/*.*=
  3. =SYS:EXECUTABLE;**;*.*.*= ↦ =/usr/bin/**/*.*=
  4. =SYS:QUICKLISP;**;*.*.*= ↦ =~/quicklisp/**/*.*=
  5. =SYS:**;*.*.*= ↦ =/usr/share/clasp/**/*.*=
- ASDF systems that are loaded as part the cclasp image are now marked as
  immutable thereby preventing ASDF from overwriting them. These systems include
  the systems acclimation, alexandria, clasp-cleavir, cleavir-ast-to-bir, 
  cleavir-ast, cleavir-ast-transformations, cleavir-attributes, cleavir-bir, 
  cleavir-bir-transformations, cleavir-compilation-policy, cleavir-conditions,
  cleavir-cst-to-ast, cleavir-ctype, cleavir-environment, 
  cleavir-io,cleavir-meter, cleavir-primop, cleavir-set, cleavir-stealth-mixins, 
  closer-mop, concrete-syntax-tree, concrete-syntax-tree-base,
  concrete-syntax-tree-destructuring, concrete-syntax-tree-lambda-list,
  eclector, and eclector-concrete-syntax-tree.
- Source code file references for Lisp and C/C++ files compiled as part of the
  Clasp binary or images are now stored using logical pathnames.
- Unicode character database updated to 2022-08-03.

** Removed
- =core:*extensions-startup-loads*= and =core:*extensions-startup-evals*=
  dynamic variables have been removed since they are no longer used.
- The =--resources-dir= command line option has been removed. Equivalent
  behavior is achieved with the =CLASP_HOME= environment variable.

** Enhancements
- =make-instance= and CLOS slot access functions can be used with structure 
  objects.
- The stepper, accessible through =step=, now has basic functionality.
- =gctools:save-lisp-and-die= now accepts a key =:executable= which can be used
  to create an executable binary with the snapshot embedded in the binary.
- =garbage-collect=, =finalize=, and =save-lisp-and-die= are now exported from
  the =ext= interface package.

** Optimizations
- Arguments to and return values from local functions (e.g. from FLET) are 
  passed unboxed in some common cases.
- Nonlocal exits are much faster in most cases, the exception being when
  the exit goes through uncooperative C++ code.
- Types inferred for many standard functions are tighter.
- Calls to some local functions with &rest parameters are more efficient.
- LENGTH is now a "vaslistable" function; &rest parameters that are only
  used for vaslistable functions can be compiled to avoid consing.
- Multiple value calls and APPLY calls to known functions can sometimes
  be optimized.
- Some MAKE-ARRAY calls are compiled more efficiently.
- Unused calls to many more (side-effect-free) standard functions are deleted.
- Accesses to 1D simple arrays of known element type are a bit faster.
- A virtual machine has been defined and implemented, greatly increasing the
  speed of evaluation of code that doesn't usually need to be optimized
  (for example, compile-time evaluations).
- The building process has been streamlined by replacing several of the
  bootstrapping components with the virtual machine.
- Discriminating functions now execute faster.
- The compiler now performs inlining much faster.

** Fixes
+ Replace hard coded paths to =nm= in snapshot code with =NM_BINARY= macro value
  set by configure.
+ Clasp can now be built directly from source. Resolves [[https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/175][issue #175]].
+ Snapshots now parse command line options such as =--noinform=, =--noprint=,
  =--quit=, and =--disable-debugger=.
+ Source locations for warnings from errors during constant folding now
  print correctly.
+ Unused calls that must remain in safe code are no longer deleted.
+ Prevent negative zero remainder in =core__next_ftruncate=. Fixes [[https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/1368][#1368]].

* <2021-05-25> Version 1.0
- Clasp has the ability to save and restart from memory snapshots.
- Clasp supports the addition of extensions written in C++ by adding them to the extensions directory.
  The extensions integrate with the clasp build system.
- The Clasp Cleavir compiler now uses basic blocks to do many new optimizations.

* <2015-11-20> Version 0.4
-  Clasp has a completely new, optimizing/inlining compiler based on Cleavir.
-  Fixnum, character and single-float types are immediate values.
-  General object pointers and cons pointers are tagged for speed.
-  Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements.
