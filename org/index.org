* Seamless Integration of Common Lisp and C++

Clasp is a new [[https://common-lisp.net/][Common Lisp]] implementation
that seamlessly interoperates with C++ libraries and programs using
[[https://llvm.org/][LLVM]] for compilation to native code. This allows
Clasp to take advantage of a vast array of preexisting libraries and
programs, such as out of the scientific computing ecosystem. Embedding
them in a Common Lisp environment allows you to make use of rapid
prototyping, incremental development, and other capabilities that make
it a powerful language.

Clasp supports [[https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/][SLIME]], [[https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/][ASDF]], and [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp]]. The usual language extensions, such as
[[https://cffi.common-lisp.dev][CFFI]], [[https://github.com/sionescu/bordeaux-threads][Bordeaux-Threads]], and [[https://unicode.org/main.html][Unicode]] characters are supported as well.
