* Command line options that control startup
- -I/--ignore-image 
- -i/--image <filename>  
- -T/--type (default|snapshot|image)
- -n/--noinit 

-I means don't load snapshot or image files. Instead proceed to load the kernel/init.lsp file.
-n means don't load the kernel/init.lsp file.
-T default means try to load the default snapshot file and if its not found proceed 
   to the default image file and if that is not found then signal an error.
-T snapshot means load the default snapshot file and if not found error.
-T image means don't load the snapshot file and load the default image file and if not found error.
-i <filename> means if the filename ends in ".snapshot" then load it as a snapshot file.
   If <filename> does not end in ".snapshot" then load it as an image - otherwise signal an error.
The -T and -i options are mutually exclusive. I can't think of any situation where you would pass them both.
The -i option will override the -T option.

* Executables with embedded snapshots

Executables with embedded snapshots always use those snapshots.
