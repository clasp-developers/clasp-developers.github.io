* Command line options that control startup

- -T/--type (default|snapshot|image)
- -i/--image <filename>  
- -I/--ignore-image 
- -n/--noinit 

=-T default= (the default) means first attempt to load the default snapshot file and if its not found then proceed 
   to the default image file and if that is not found then terminate with an error.

=-T snapshot= means load the default snapshot file and if not found then terminate with an error. The default
snapshot file is (in the Common Lisp logical pathname notation) "app-fasl:<executable-name>.snapshot".

=-T image= means load the default image file and if that is not found then terminate with an error.
The default image file is (in the Common Lisp logical pathname notation) "app-fasl:<executable-name>.<fasl-extension>". 
The <fasl-extension> changes depending on how clasp is built.

=-i <filename>= means if the filename ends in ".snapshot" then load it as a snapshot file.
   If <filename> does not end in ".snapshot" then load it as an image - otherwise signal an error.
The -T and -i options are mutually exclusive. The -i option will override the -T option.

=-I= means don't load snapshot or image files. Instead proceed to load the kernel/init.lsp file.

=-n= Used with -I. If this is passed then don't load the init.lsp file. This will start a very bare 
bones REPL and load no Common Lisp code.

* Executables with embedded snapshots

Executables with embedded snapshots always use those snapshots.
